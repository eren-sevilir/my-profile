	<p>
		Since 2021, I have been giving online Turkish language lessons to foreigners through the Preply platform. In line with the goals and expectations of my students, and in accordance with the "Turkish as a Foreign Language" curriculum and the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) structure, I prepare educational content to improve language skills at A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 levels and for free learners.

		<h2>Volunteering and Engagement üå±</h2>
	<p>
		I show a particular interest for social responsibility projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've been an active volunteer in the Educational Volunteers Foundation of T√ºrkiye (TEGV) since 2017, where I teach English and Mathematics to elementary school students, via face-to-face and online learning programs. I'm also a trainer/instructor within this association for which I work with the administration to develop and conduct training programs for volunteers.

	<p>
		Additionally, I'm a founder of a volunteering community in my high school named "Volunteers of Saint-Beno√Æt (SBG)". Since its foundation, SBG works with its army of volunteers to reach out to people in need through awareness and social aid projects. We conduct workshops, fields trips, charity bazars and donations for the target groups we identify.
